### Resources

I have collected some notes and resources over time.  

**IB Math HL**\
This is the order of math I use
- Kognity if I really don't understand a topic (generally the teacher should explain it well enough to the point you shouldn't need this).
- Revision Village videos to quickly grasp a topic
- Oxford Math Textbook, I just do all the exercises and then the chapter review
- Christos Nikolaidis Exercises
- Christos Nikolaidis test
- Revision Village tests
- IB Questionbank/ Revision Village Questionbank
