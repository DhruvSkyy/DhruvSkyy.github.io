### Resources

I have collected some notes and resources over time.  

**IB Math HL**\
This is the order of math I use
- Kognity if I really don't understand a topic (generally the teacher should explain it well enough to the point you shouldn't need this).
- Revision Village videos to quickly grasp a topic
- Oxford Math Textbook, I just do all the exercises and then the chapter review
- Christos Nikolaidis Exercises
- Christos Nikolaidis test
- Revision Village tests
- IB Questionbank/ Revision Village Questionbank

### Motivation
I used to be really bad student for a while until I had kind of a realization and starting working better.
I attribute this a lot to philosophy (mainly Camus).
I strongly encourage you to question your existence for a while before you try and push yourself towards goals. The existential crisis is worth it. A lot of people typically say that motivation means nothing compared to discipline and I find that a really important part is missing. You need motivation to start building discipline. At least that's what worked for me.  
I encourage you to find your own meaning but I built myself of Camus, Nietzsche and a little sprinkling of my own goals/ meaning to life. It took me about a month to kind of reawaken and rather periodically I reflect on my philosophy which I've written down and add amendments and such. This helps me continue to find meaning in what I've seen people give up/ breakdown over working. I also have a system of 'Principles' which I learnt from Ray Dalio which I found helped.
