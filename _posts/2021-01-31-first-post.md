### How I made this Site

I used to use Wordpress but I found Jekyll a lot more practical/ useful as I progressed in Web Design.

I run this site using github pages, it uses Jekyll and I'm currently using an updated theme for Hyde named [Hydeout](https://github.com/fongandrew/hydeout). Being able to edit every aspect of your site freely is a lot more fun. Catbug is pretty cool.
