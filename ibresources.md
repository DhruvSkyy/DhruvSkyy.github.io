### Resources

I have collected some notes and resources over time.  

**IB Math HL AA**\
Still useful for other math courses in the IB, the websites linked generally have sections for the other courses.\
This is the order of math I use
- Revision Village videos to quickly grasp a topic - [Revision Village](https://www.revisionvillage.com/)
- If Revision Village doesn't explain it well look below for the resources to learn math or Kognity.
- Oxford Math Textbook, I just do all the exercises and then the chapter review
- [Christos Nikolaidis Exercises](https://www.christosnikolaidis.com/en/maa-exercise/)
- [Christos Nikolaidis Tests](https://www.christosnikolaidis.com/en/maa-tests/)
- [Revision Village Tests](https://www.revisionvillage.com/ib-math-analysis-and-approaches-hl/practice-exams/)
- [IB Questionbank](https://www.ibdocuments.com/IB%20QUESTIONBANKS/4.%20Fourth%20Edition/questionbank.ibo.org/en/teachers/00000/questionbanks/7-dp-mathematics-hl/syllabus_sections.html)/ Revision Village Questionbank

Other resources which explain the math well
- [Exam Solutions](https://www.examsolutions.net/international-exams/international-baccalaureate/higher-level/), it also has really good videos which explain each topic.

- [Math IAs](https://ibmathsresources.com/maths-ia-maths-exploration-topics/), also serves as a general guide to HL Math.
- The [Mathematics Stack Exchange](https://math.stackexchange.com/) is helpful (look through similar questions first).
- [Harvard Calc 1a](http://people.math.harvard.edu/~knill/teaching/math1a2020/), the notes are useful.
