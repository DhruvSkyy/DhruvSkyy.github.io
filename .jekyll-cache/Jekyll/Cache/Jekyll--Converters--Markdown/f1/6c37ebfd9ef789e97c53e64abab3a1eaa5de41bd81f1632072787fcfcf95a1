I"~<p>I used to use Wordpress but I found Jekyll a lot more practical/ useful as I progressed in Web Design.</p>

<p>I run this site using github pages, it uses Jekyll and Iâ€™m currently using an updated theme for Hyde named <a href="https://github.com/fongandrew/hydeout">Hydeout</a>. Being able to edit every aspect of your site freely is a lot more fun. Catbug is pretty cool.</p>
