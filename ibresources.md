### IB Resources 

The following are a list of resources I have found useful during the IB. I highly recommend doing topicwise past paper questions for each topic in subjects such as mathematics, chemistry, biology and economics as an efficient way to prepare for exams and tests, links to these can be found in this page. 

 

**Useful Blogs IB**

These blogs contain several helpful notes and IAs for multiple subjects for the IB.

[The Science Codex](https://thesciencecodex.wordpress.com/ib-biology-notes/) 
[IB Dead](https://ib-dead.weebly.com/ib-chemistry.html)
[Chiron](https://yuvalamichay.wordpress.com/)
[Reasonable Deviations](https://reasonabledeviations.com/Notes/)
[Clastify](https://www.clastify.com/) 



**IB Math HL AA**

In my experience, doing past paper questions provided better results than textbooks and worksheets and saved much time. The following resources provide comprehensive lists of past paper questions.  

- [Christos Nikolaidis Exercises](https://www.christosnikolaidis.com/en/maa-exercise/)


- [Christos Nikolaidis Tests](https://www.christosnikolaidis.com/en/maa-tests/)
- [Revision Village Tests](https://www.revisionvillage.com/ib-math-analysis-and-approaches-hl/practice-exams/) - Revision Village Questionbank is also useful 
- [IB Questionbank](https://www.ibdocuments.com/IB%20QUESTIONBANKS/4.%20Fourth%20Edition/questionbank.ibo.org/en/teachers/00000/questionbanks/7-dp-mathematics-hl/syllabus_sections.html)
- [Another Questionbank](https://ibtaskmaker.com/maker.php)

Of course, understanding is also important. I have found that these resources allow for meaningful depth and clarity when looking into topics. 

- Revision Village videos to quickly grasp a topic - [Revision Village](https://www.revisionvillage.com/)
- The [Mathematics Stack Exchange](https://math.stackexchange.com/) is helpful (look through similar questions first).
- [Exam Solutions](https://www.examsolutions.net/international-exams/international-baccalaureate/higher-level/), it also has really good videos which explain each topic.

For Calculus

- [Harvard Calc 1a](http://people.math.harvard.edu/~knill/teaching/math1a2020/), the notes are useful.
- [Curve Sketching](http://pi.math.cornell.edu/~goldberg/Math1110/Curves.pdf), good for calculus
- [Professor Leonard](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoHhuummRZaIVX7bD4t2czg), good for calculus

Potentially useful - I personally didn't benefit from these but they are still worth a look. 

- [cbhughes](https://sites.google.com/view/cbhughesmath/ib-aa-hl)
- [Mr Mac Maths](https://www.mrmacmaths.com/calculus), notes for the entire syllabus.
- [Another blog](https://ib-dead.weebly.com/ib-math.html), has nice links to resources.

IAs

- [Math IAs](https://ibmathsresources.com/maths-ia-maths-exploration-topics/), also serves as a general guide to HL Math. Helpful Notes. Some of the more advanced notes could be helpful for Math IAs.





**IB Chem HL**

Notes for understanding:

[Some notes](https://ib-dead.weebly.com/ib-chemistry.html)
[More Notes](https://thesciencecodex.wordpress.com/ib-chemistry/)

Practice Questions:

- [Mr. Massey's Chemistry Pages](https://masseychem.weebly.com/ib-review-answer-keys.html)
- [IBDP SL & HL CHEMISTRY](https://sites.google.com/a/nisbah.com/chemistry/IBDP-Chemistry/dp-chemistry)
- [IB Questionbank](https://www.ibdocuments.com/IB%20QUESTIONBANKS/4.%20Fourth%20Edition/questionbank.ibo.org/en/teachers/00000/questionbanks/45-dp-chemistry/syllabus_sections.html) 





**IB Bio HL**
Notes for understanding:

[Flashcards](https://www.brainscape.com/packs/ib-biology-hl-10427849)
[Some notes](https://ib-dead.weebly.com/ib-biology.html)
[More Notes](https://thesciencecodex.wordpress.com/ib-biology-notes/)
[Bioninja](http://bioninja.com.au/)
These [MIT Lectures](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/biology/7-01sc-fundamentals-of-biology-fall-2011/molecular-biology/dna-structure-classic-experiments/), good for molecular biology.  

Practice Questions:

[IB Questionbank](https://www.ibdocuments.com/IB%20QUESTIONBANKS/4.%20Fourth%20Edition/questionbank.ibo.org/en/teachers/00000/questionbanks/43-dp-biology/syllabus_sections.html)

- they also have topicwise pdfs which I found especially useful for Biology

[Topic wise Questions](https://sites.google.com/a/canacad.ac.jp/sl-hl-1-biology-4-ferguson/previous-essay-questions)

There are also some google docs online which link together the main/ frequently asked questions for each topic. 

It is especially important to memorize for biology as the markscheme is quite strict regarding terminology. Although it is still nice to dive into topics for fun, for example the MIT lectures. 

IAs:
