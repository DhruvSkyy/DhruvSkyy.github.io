title: The Oxford Chemistry Interview
category: IB 
---
I had applied to Magdalen College, Oxford for Chemistry in October 2021 and received an interview. The following post will detail the interview process and what I think would have led me to being better prepared for it. <!--more-->

I had received two interviews, one in inorganic and organic chemistry and the other in physical chemistry. Both interviews lasted 30 minutes, with two interviewers. Due to COVID, they were online. Although I am unsure of whether I can discuss the exact contents of the questions, the style of the interview was quite different than expected. 

Online, I had typically found two types of sample questions, the first being like such: 

> Why do we blow on soup to cool it down?

These questions were seen as encouraging thinking out loud and explaining the idea. 

The second type were of:

> How many molecules are there in a glass of water?

These are labelled as ‘approximation questions’, they encourage conversations about uncertainty, and test the candidates’ mathematical skills. 

During my actual interview, the type of questions I received were rather different to the above types of questions. This is not to say will not come up for your interview, my singular experience likely does not reflect all the interviews which went through. 

A week before the interviews I watched a video of tips by some current Oxford Chemistry students, one of which highly recommending ‘C3L6’, Cambridge’s chemistry Olympiad for first year A level students. I did some practice test leading up to the interview and found I struggled through them. Unfortunately, the interview was like doing C3L6 but aloud. 

My main advice would be to simply practice C3L6 much more beforehand. The Chemistry Olympiad (based on both years of A level material), would also be useful. Although it didn’t come up in my interview, practicing the two other common types of questions is also helpful as it may very well still show up in yours. 

With the actual content also, I feel that is quite important to go through the entire syllabus of your chemistry course before the interview. It is likely a large amount of the candidates did the Chemistry Olympiad which is based on both years of A level content and did quite well. 

As an IB student I was aware that A level students had done a large amount of organic chemistry in their first year, while in my case it was done near the end of the second year of the IB. I self-studied the entire topic, and it did form quite a large part of my interview. The topics were quite scattered across the syllabus for both A level and IB, so I strongly recommend completing the syllabus before the interview. 

My personal statement was not asked about at all, although I feel it would be quite easy for them to do so. I wouldn’t recommend bluffing or over exaggerating about topics in it. For resources about the personal statement you can check the IB Resources section [here]({% link ibresources.md %}). 

I did read a few chapters of ‘how chemical reactions happen’ before the interview. Unless time is taken, and the material is really understood it (not skimming it) it does not really benefit your application. You cannot make links to it in the interview unless it is properly understood. It was not mentioned in the interview. I found it quite a difficult read and it would probably take quiet a lot of time to understand it in depth. 

Overall, I would simply suggest adding the Olympiad to your preparations for the interview. Practice answering the questions out loud, talking to yourself to practice communicating with the interview. Also try to complete the entire A level syllabus, this is where the questions are primarily based from so even as an IB student you should go through it. 

However, please remember that a singular experience is not representative for the many colleges and interviews. Try to find other advice as well as this one to prepare yourself for the interview. For example, some may say to primarily focus on just understanding the syllabus and reading other syllabi from other boards which may be worthwhile advice along with doing the Olympiad.
